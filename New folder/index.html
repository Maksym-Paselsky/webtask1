          <p class="lead" id='customp'>"Jack" (also known as Samurai Jack or simply The Samurai) is the alias taken by a Japanese warrior (with an unknown birth name) who acts as the titular protagonist of the cartoon Samurai Jack. Throughout the series, he is voiced by Phil LaMarr.

              Since youth, Jack trained in many different areas under numerous teachers in a variety of skills to defeat the demon Aku. However, Aku's dark magic sent Jack eons into the future, where he ruled all of Earth unopposed. Jack made it his mission to find a way back to his time and prevent Aku's dystopia. Throughout his travels, Jack became an infamous freedom fighter, protecting and aiding numerous civilizations and innocents terrorized by Aku's forces and other malevolent foes.
              
              Due to his many revolts against Aku's rule and being the only person capable of killing him (because of his divinely crafted sword) he was the most wanted man in the world. After more than 50 years, Jack finally returned to the past and defeated Aku, creating a brighter future.</p>

          <p class="lead" id='customp'>Aku constantly antagonized Samurai Jack: he often attacked him when he was weak, and other times defended himself from Jack's own gambits. Prior to Ashi sending Jack back in time to vanquish Aku's past self, the two seem doomed never to defeat each other, and while Jack had beaten Aku on numerous occasions, Aku merely transformed into a creature, retreated, and usually called out a taunt over his shoulder. Aku was entirely aware of his inability to defeat Jack and even lamp-shaded that in "Episode XLVIII: Jack versus Aku", which eventually discouraged him from fighting Jack further. Aku could have been considered the Deuteragonist of the series as a whole (albeit a rare, villainous one), as while Ashi became that in Season 5. Aku had the most focus in the narrative besides Jack.

              While he's usually presented as a serious and threatening foe, Aku was also a source of comedy in the show, due to his outrageous design and sometimes wise-guy behavior, that was supported by Mako's over the top voice-acting.
              
              Aku means "Evil" in Japanese.</p>

She was born and raised as a member of the Daughters of Aku, seven sisters who served as assassins attempting to kill Jack. She would later become the only surviving member and unwillingly accompany Jack. It was only later that she came to have doubts about Aku's true nature after Jack saves her life and she makes a full turn-around when he shows her the destruction Aku has unleashed on the world.

              She served as Jack's most important ally in Season 5, in Episode XCIX she and Jack eventually fall in love with each other. Eventually, after meeting Aku in person in Episode C, it is revealed that Aku was her biological father, after which he corrupts her unwillingly into his service.</p>
